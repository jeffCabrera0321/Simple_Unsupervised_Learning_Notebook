# Machine Learning with Unsupervised Learning: PCA and KMeans

## By: Jeffrey Cabrera

This project provides a simple example of how unsupervised learning techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and KMeans Clustering, can be applied to analyze and interpret data without predefined labels. Using sample datasets, we explore dimensionality reduction and clustering to uncover patterns and structures.

The code was written with a notebook.

### Introduction
Unsupervised learning is a branch of machine learning that identifies patterns in unlabeled data.

**PCA** simplifies datasets by reducing the number of dimensions while retaining essential information. <br />
**KMeans Clustering** groups data points into clusters based on their similarities.
This project demonstrates these concepts using sample datasets.

### Install packages
Run `pip install requirements.txt`

### Conclusion

This project highlights the use of PCA for simplifying datasets and KMeans for identifying patterns. These techniques are foundational for exploratory data analysis and can be applied to a wide range of datasets in various domains.

Further steps could include:
* Experimenting with more advanced clustering methods
* Applying these techniques to real-world datasets for domain-specific insights
